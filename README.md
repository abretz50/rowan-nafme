# Rowan NAfME Website

Modern, responsive static site themed to Rowan NAfME colors.

## Quick start
- Open `index.html` locally, or deploy the entire folder to Netlify/GitHub Pages.
- The navbar and footer are shared partials loaded by `assets/js/nav.js` from `/partials/*.html`.
  - If your site is not hosted at the domain root, set `window.SITE_BASE = "/your/base/path"` at the top of each page before loading `nav.js`.

## Colors
Pulled from your assets:
- Blue: #1f78ff
- Cyan: #00c9d8
- Purple: #6a39ff
- Yellow: #ffd100

## Editing
- Update content in each page.
- Replace officer names/emails on `eboard.html`.
- Add real links/files on `resources.html`.
- Edit events in `assets/js/events.js` (`EVENTS` array).

## Assets
- `/images/logo.png` – from your provided logo.
- `/images/background.png` – gradient background used in the hero.
